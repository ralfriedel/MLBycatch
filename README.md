## Summary
Discards from commercial fisheries have been linked to detrimental effects on ecosystems and economies worldwide. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of discards may assist in devising regulatory practices and mitigation strategies toward more sustainable fisheries practices. This study investigates data from bycatch at sea onboard monitoring programs using a machine learning approach. Machine learning has successfully revealed trends and patterns in various ecological applications, potentially providing a way forward as an alternative and complementary methodological approach in fisheries. We used a gradient boosting classifier for describing catch and bycatch patterns in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Black Seabass (Centropristis striata), Summer Flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), Scup (Stenotomus chrysops), and Longfin Squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) fishery. We used oceanographic, biological, spatial, and fisheries model features. We found positive associations between target species volume and bycatch. Although we found that sea surface temperature and year were important model features, the direction of impact of those predictors was variable. This study concludes that machine learning approaches are promising in supplementing traditional methodologies, especially with the increase in data availability trends.

## Introduction and Justification
Bycatch, the discarded of unwanted catch, is a long-reported problem in many fisheries worldwide. It has estimated that the annual magnitude of worldwide discarded biomass averaged 7.3 million tons or around 8% of the total global catch. In that analysis it was reported that demersal finfish trawling had a relatively low discard rate but contributed substantially to the total amount of discards worldwide because of its ubiquity. The impacts of discards are both economic and ecological. 

To mitigate problems with bycatch, data collection programs have been conducted at state and federal levels. That data has grown to proportions enabling alternate analytical venues to be implemented. As the volume of bycatch data increases such alternative analytical approaches supplement traditional methodologies. The process we offer in this repository is one of such approaches, commonly refered to as machine learning (ML). ML algorithms learn patterns in data to arrive at predictions. In this work, using data from the federal observer program, we investigate the ability of ML to analyze temporal and spatial patterns in the catch of incidentally caught living marine resources in a suite of mid-Atlantic fisheries. We evaluate the observer data collected by NOAA Fisheries in the federal waters of the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions. We describe fishery-specific bycatch patterns for the Summer Flounder, Scup, Black Seabass, and Longfin Squid fisheries. We then used these data to understand the spatial and temporal characteristics that influence bycatch weight and species richness using machine learning. Our specific objectives are to (1) describe temporal and spatial patterns of bycatch in the Scup, Black Sea Bass, Longfin Squid, and Summer Flounder fisheries, and (2) to use ML techniques to understand how gear, temporal, spatial, and environmental characteristics can be used to describe contrasts in bycatch magnitude and taxonomic richness.
